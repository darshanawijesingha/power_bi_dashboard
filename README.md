# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Membership Analytics Challenge  
**Optimize Retention, Revenue, and Engagement at MyGym**

This project is part of the **Fitness Membership Analytics Challenge**, where the goal is to analyze MyGym’s membership data and build insightful dashboards. MyGym is a fast-growing fitness chain across California offering multiple membership tiers, pricing models, and amenities.  

Using the dataset, I created a **2-page interactive dashboard** that provides actionable insights on retention, revenue, engagement, and customer behavior.
